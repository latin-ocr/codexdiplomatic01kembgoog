sheets might be mislaid or worn out, if too frequently
produced for the inspection of either friends or foes;
a digested copy of all the land-titles was easier to use,
and tended to secure the safety of the originals.
From tirn'e to time these Registers or Chartnlaries

period3 they thus offer to the scientific philologist a
mass of data upon which inquiries into the progress
and changes of language can be most securely founded.
In many cases they have preserved to us copies of
charters whose originals are no longer found3 and as
they have also preserved copies of many which we
possess in their first and oldest form, they supply the
means of comparison and induction as to the genuine·
