bearing the second name, but that it is uncertain
whether the places are the same.

Lastly, where the medem name is printed in italic
character, it marks an attempt to suggest the name

which may be borne hya corresponding place in the
same county. Thus, when Ι write

Aehangra 1094.
Oukhaager,llants,
1 intend to say that Achangra was in Hampshire‚ and
that if there is any corresponding place in that county,
it is now probably known hythe name of Oakhanger,
hut that I have no means of kuowing whether there is
such a place or not. .

It is obvious that the local knowledge of those
whose opportunities favour such investigatione, will
find its best field in this class of names. The sug-
gestions are founded upon the analogies of other
names, and the well-ascertained rules of change which
Anglosaxon words in general manifest in their gra-
dual deolension into English, still this is at the best
an uncertain portion of my labour, and probably is
full of errore. By printing itin a different type Ι
have endeavoured to guard the reader from accepting
what seem probahilities to me for ascertained facts3
but experience has shewn that these guasses are some·
times fortunate: since the index was hegun, many
words have been removed from the fourth into the
second claSS, and itis to he hoped that many more
may yet he found worthy of a similar transposition.
