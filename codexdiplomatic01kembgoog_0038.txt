These are the principal sources from which the
conteuts of the preceding volumes have been taken,
aud it requires only a glauce to convince any impar·
tial person, how difficult it would have been to make
any use of the charters while they remained dispersed
in so many different repositories. This difficulty was
greatly enhanced by the confused manner in which
the documents are heaped together in the registers
and chartularios, where no chronological order is ever
thought of. Moreover, of the whole number of docu-
ments, about a fourth, aud the boundaries of nearly
011, are written iu Anglosaxon, a lauguage which is
not sufficiently cultivated iu Euglaud now, but which
was still more neglected by the early Norman tran-
scribens: 10 tho difficulty theu of non-access was
added that arising from the careless writing 01 iguo-
rant copyists. On all these grounds, therefore, it was
much to be desired that a complete collection should
be made, arranged in order 01 time, aud iu which the
errors of the copyists should be corrected, as far as
our present state 01 knowledge permitted. Thisl
have attempted to accomplish; aud though 1 aru only
too well aware how far removed from faultless tha
execution of the work has proved, I am not without
hope that it will still he found uo trifling boon to the
legal antiquary and the philologist. >
